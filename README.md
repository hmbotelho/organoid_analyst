## <a name="overview">1. Overview</a>

The [forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) assay](#references) is a microscopy-based live cell assay which assesses the efficacy of established and investigational CFTR-modulating compounds for individuals that suffer from cystic fibrosis (CF) [[1](#ref01)].

Organoid Analyst is an R shiny web application for the statistical analysis of FIS data, enabling:
* Interactive data inspection
* Image visualization (*via* [Fiji](http://fiji.sc/))
* Per-object and per-well quality control
* Plotting
* Data normalization
* Generation of publication-ready datasets





## <a name="background">2. Statistical background</a>


Within Organoid Analyst, data normalization uses the following algorithm:
1. Sum the area of all organoids in each image  
2. Compute kinetic curves for each well: total organoid area _vs_ time  
3. Normalize kinetic curves (Area in the first time point = A₀ = 100%)  
4. Compute the area under the curve of the normalized kinetic curves (baseline = 100%)  
5. Export the following measurements (mean, standard deviation, count and SEM):  
    - **AUC (area under the curve):** calculated between the first and the last time points of the experiment (usually: 0 and 60 min).
    - **ISR (initial swelling rate):** the slope of a line fitted to the region of maximal linear swelling as measured in the normalized kinetic curves.
    - **Aₜ/A₀:** normalized area value at the final time point of the FIS assay (Aₜ), using normalization factor A₀ = 100%.

## <a name="dataset">5. Demonstration dataset</a>

A demonstration dataset is provided [here](https://github.com/hmbotelho/FIS_analysis/tree/master/demo_dataset).

**Assay description**  
The FIS assay was performed using intestinal organoids homozygous for a class II CFTR mutation in the absence (DMSO) or presence of VX-809 and/or VX-770 (3.2 μM), as previously described [[2](#ref02)]. CFTR was activated by addition of forskolin (Fsk) in a concentration range from 0.008 μM – 5 μM. The layout of the assay plate is depicted below.

<p align="center"><img src="./img/schemes/plate_layout_733x205.png"></p>

These are the main characteristics of the microscopy images in the demonstration dataset:

- __Imaging system:__ Zeiss confocal microscope
- __Number of plates:__ 1
- __Number of wells:__ 64
- __Number of imaging fields per well:__ 1
- __Number of raw images:__ 448
- __Number of timepoints:__ 7
- __Time interval between frames:__ 10 min
- __Total experiment time:__ 60 min
- __Image resolution:__ 512 x 512 pixels  
- __Pixel dimensions:__ 4.991 x 4.991 μm

- __Number of fluorescence channels:__ 1 (calcein green)

The demonstration dataset is comprised of:
1. [**Raw microscopy images**](https://github.com/hmbotelho/FIS_analysis/tree/master/demo_dataset/03-images_renamed/demoplate_01) (91.8 MB)
2. [**Image quantification: object-level area measurements**](https://github.com/hmbotelho/FIS_analysis/tree/master/demo_dataset/05-images_analysis/demoplate_01--cellprofiler) (14.8 MB)
3. [**Analysis of the demonstration dataset with Organoid Analyst**](https://github.com/hmbotelho/FIS_analysis/tree/master/demo_dataset/05-images_analysis/demoplate_01--cellprofiler--analysis) (37.0 MB)


Image analysis was performed with a [pipeline from CellProfiler 3.1.9](./CellProfiler_pipeline).





## <a name="analysis">6. Analysis of a demonstration dataset</a>

Organoid Analyst is designed to analyze data from one plate at a time.

1. Run Organoid Analyst by typing the following on the R console:

```
library(shiny)
runGitHub("organoid_analyst", "hmbotelho", launch.browser = T)
```

2. Organoid Analyst will open in a new browser window
    
    <p align="center"><img src="./img/gui/start.png"></p>

3. The numbered items at the top navigation bar define the sequential steps involved in data analysis: loading data, specifying analysis settings, plotting and exporting results.

4. Under `1. Load data`, click on `Choose a '--cellprofiler' or '--ij' folder...` and select the [folder](https://github.com/hmbotelho/FIS_analysis/tree/master/demo_dataset/05-images_analysis/demoplate_01--cellprofiler) `demoplate_01--cellprofiler` from the demonstration dataset.

    <p align="center"><img src="./img/gui/openfolder.png"></p>

5. Organoid Analyst will concatenate the `objects.csv` files (one per well) generated during the image analysis process. This will generate a data table containing all data from the experiment. 

6. The raw data table can be inspected by clicking `View data > Raw data table (concatenated)`.

    <p align="center"><img src="./img/gui/viewraw.png"></p>

7. Each row in the table represents a single organoid in a single image. Each column represents one feature (measurement or metadata).

    <p align="center"><img src="./img/gui/rawtable.png"></p>

8. Click on `2. Settings`.

9. In this section, inform Organoid Analyst of which columns in the data table contain relevant data (_e.g._ organoid area), as well as of the type of multi well plate used in the experiment, quality control information and file locations:

    * **Experiment Settings:** names of columns containing the experiment metadata and the time resolution of the experiment.

    * **Quality Control Settings:** Coordinates of organoid centroids and labels of organoids which should not be considered in the analysis. In the demonstration dataset, organoids which are not tracked during the entire time lapse (*e.g.* organoids which touch and become insistinguishable of each other) were assigned the label `NaN` in column `TrackObjects_Label_4`. This annotation can be used to exclude those organoids from analysis.

    * **File Remapping Settings:** This module enables opening raw images, even if their location is not the same as when they were analyzes (*e.g.* when image quantification and data analysis are performed on different computers). In order for this to be possible, the user must provide the location of the [raw image folder](https://github.com/hmbotelho/FIS_analysis/tree/master/demo_dataset/03-images_renamed/demoplate_01) in the computer that performed the image analysis and in the computer running Organoid Analyst. Whenever the file remapping settings are correct, a **`Found file!`** notice will be shown. See the table below for an example.

    * **Segmentation Masks Settings:** Determines whether segmentation masks should be updated according to the quality control parameter defined above.

    * **Interaction with Fiji Settings:** The location of the Fiji / ImageJ executable file of the computer running Organoid Analyst. Only required for Windows and not for MacOS.
    
    Below are the settings which were used to analyze the demo dataset.

10. Click on `Normalize data`.

11. Organoid Analyst will exclude all organoids which do not meet the quality control parameter, normalize the data and update the segmentation masks. This may take a few minutes.

12. After normalization has completed, the corresponding data table can be inspected by clicking `View data > Normalized data`:

    <p align="center"><img src="./img/gui/viewnormtable.png"></p>

13. Each row in the table represents a whole image (*i.e.* one time frame). Each column represents one feature (measurement or metadata).

    <p align="center"><img src="./img/gui/normtable.png"></p>
    
14. Click on  `3. Plotting`.

15. This section allows interactive data exploration, image visualization and per well quality control.

    <p align="center"><img src="./img/gui/plot_crop.png"></p>

    The following features are available:
    
    * **Analysis settings:** Defines the final time point for the experiment and the time points to be used for the calculation of the initial swelling rate.
        
    * **Quality control:** Allows excluding individual wells from the analysis (_e.g._ wells with imaging aberrations or insufficient organoids). Selected wells will be hidden from all generated plots and summary statistics.
        
    * **Timelapse viewer:** Allows for opening and inspection of an arbitrary number of wells as time lapse sequences in Fiji. Start by selecting the wells of interest and clicking the ![Open movies in Fiji](./img/gui/openmovies.png) button. Fiji will open in a new window as shown below. Raw fluorescence images will be overlaid with segmentation masks and organoid labels from the analyses.
    
    <p align="center"><img src="./img/gui/CP--08_OA_IJ.png"></p>
        
    * **Plots:** Organoid Analyst visualizes the quantitative FIS data in five different plots:
    
        * Multi-well plate layout with the normalized kinetic curves being displayed for each well. The plot can also show the ISR.  
    
        * Dose-response plot for AUC measurements. For this plot to be appropriately generated, the infile must contain strictly numerical values for the compound concentration field.
    
        * Bar plots representing summarized AUC, ISR and Aₜ/A₀ measurements (average ± standard deviation, across identically treated wells).  


    The demonstration dataset was analyzed using the following settings:

    | **Parameter**                    | **Value** |
    |----------------------------------|-----------|
    | Select initial data points       | 10 ~ 30   |
    | Select final experiment time     | 60        |
    | Wells excluded from calculations | None      |
    
16. Click the `Export data` button to save the analyzed dataset to the output folder.

17. Organoid Analyst will save the following files:

    * **Updated segmentation masks**
    * **Updated organoid labels**
    * `FIS_normalized.xlsx` Data for individual wells: sum of all organoid areas, normalized areas, normalized areas subtracted of the 100% baseline, and cumulative AUC.
    * `FIS_rawdata.csv` Concatenation of the objects.csv files into a single data table.
    * `FIS_summary_xxmin.xlsx` Per-treatment summary of AUC, ISR and Aₜ/A₀ measurements.
    * `FISanalysis_dd-mm-yy_hh-ss.log` Organoid Analyst settings at the moment of data export.
    * `plot_AtA0_xxmin.png` Bar plot of summarized Aₜ/A₀ measurements.
    * `plot_AUC_xxmin.png` Bar plot of summarized AUC measurements at the final time point of the experiment.
    * `plot_initialswellingrate_xxmin.png` Bar plot of summarized ISR measurements.
    * `plot_overview.png` Plate layout with normalized kinetic curves.
    * `plot_titration_AUC_xxmin.png` Dose-response plot for AUC measurements at the final time point of the experiment.

## <a name="troubleshooting">8. Troubleshooting</a>

This section contains fixes for the most common problems one may find when installing or running Organoid Analyst.


**Fiji cannot run (macOS only)**  
If you get the following message when attempting to run Fiji:

`"Fiji" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.`

There are two ways to enable Fiji:

* **Solution 1**: Open the Applications folder, right click Fiji and click `Open`. You should then get the following message: `macOS cannot verify the developer of "Fiji". Are you sure you want to open it?`. Click OK.
    
 * **Solution 2**: Go to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General`. Select `Open Anyway` on Fiji.

**Packages fail to install**  
If any of the R packages required for Organoid Analyst fails to install one of the following error messages (or similar) will be displayed:

```
Loading required package: raster
Error in library(x, character.only = TRUE) :
  there is no package called 'raster'
```

```
Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘raster’
```

```
ERROR: dependency 'sp' is not available for package 'raster'
```

This means that the package needs to be manually installed with

```
install.packages("raster")
```

Then, run Organoid Analyst with

```
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmbotelho/organoid_analyst/master/installer.R")
runGitHub("organoid_analyst", "hmbotelho", launch.browser=T)
```

**Note**: Older R versions may not be compatible with the current version of some packages. This may be solved by installing older package versions. To do this find the [package webpage on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html), go into the `Old sources` section and get the URL for an older `tar.gz` package file. Then, install it

```
install.packages("https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/xxxx/xxxx_0.0.0.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
```
